# Digital Clock Project

## Summary Explanation
This project is a **Digital Clock** web application that dynamically displays the current date, day, and time. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and functional digital clock. The application is styled with gradient effects and custom fonts for a modern look.

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic Time Display**:
   - The current time updates every second in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
   - The time is displayed in a bold, modern style using the `Orbitron` font from Google Fonts.

2. **Date and Day Information**:
   - The application shows the current day and date in a readable format like `Wednesday, March 12, 2001`.
   - The display is styled with a gradient background and a comic-themed font for uniqueness.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout is centered and scales well to fit various screen sizes.
   - Elements like the clock container and day display are designed with rounded corners and colorful gradients for an appealing UI.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **HTML**
   - Defines the structure of the web application.
   - Includes two main sections: one for the date (`#dayIntro`) and another for the time (`.dispClock`).

### 2. **CSS**
   - Provides an engaging design using gradients, custom fonts, and styling for both the day and time sections.
   - Ensures the UI is centered and visually consistent across devices.
   - Integrates the Google Font `Orbitron` for the clock and `Comic Sans MS` for the day information.

### 3. **JavaScript**
   - Implements real-time functionality using the `Date` object.
   - Functions:
     - `updateTime()`: Updates the clock every second with the current hours, minutes, and seconds.
     - `updateDayIntro()`: Formats and displays the current day and date.
   - Uses `setInterval` to continuously refresh the clock.

## How It Works

1. When the application loads:
   - The `updateDayIntro()` function runs to display the current date and day.
   - The `updateTime()` function is triggered by a `setInterval` loop to update the time every second.

2. The CSS and HTML layout work together to present the information in a visually appealing and accessible way.
